# Unmasked
*Oakland University - CSI 4999 - Senior Capstone - Fall 2021*

## Problem Statement
With the rampant spread of the delta variant, and now the existence of Omicron. Schools and communities are looking now more than ever to enforce social distancing and mask mandates for the safety of their communities.

## Our Solution
We concluded a need for a Mask Detection/Facial Recognition system that will detect people within the school system who are not wearing a mask in an effort to provide schools and effective methood to enforce mask mandates and solve a portion of this problem.


# Primary Themes
Public health and safety, in addition to social responsibilities and ethical considerations. It is a social system in that it will have a large social impact, and it is Ethical in the sense that we as communities have an ethical duty to have our populations best interest at heart.



## How It Was Accomplished
- We Adopted the Agile Scrum Process
- Applied a Divide and Conquer Approach
- Established a team specific workflow
- Created supporting backlogs and Use cases


## Technoologies Used
- Firebase
- Python/Django
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
- OpenCV
- Figma & Webflo

## Our Team and Roles
Scrum Master- Jasmin Medic
Product Owner - Justin Chorazyczewski
Back-End - Rachel Yang, Andy Liu
Front-end - Nancy Hana

## Challenges We Faced As A Team
This kind of project was a new frontier for us. Neither of us have had previous Machine Learning Experiences and there was a significant learning curve with regards to our technology stack. We learned a lot about the limitations of our software. And the sheer amount of knowledge still left to be learned with regards to machine learning and it's applications.

## Key System Components
- Facial Detection
- Facial Recognition
- Database
- UI


## Current Working Features
- Live identification of mask status of an individual
- Pattern Searching database for said individual
- Documenting the offense and storing it
- Notifying Individual via email of offense
- UI for administrative Use
- CRUD functionality for adding students and maintaining training Data

## Software Limitations
- Limited to frontal face detection
- limited to identifying 1 individual at a time
- Scalability with regards to massive amounts of data
